<h1>Oh Captain My Captain</h1>
<pre>
O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
The ship has weatherâ€™d every rack, the prize we sought is won,
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
                But O heart! heart! heart!
                O the bleeding drops of red,
                Where on the deck my Captain lies,
                Fallen cold and dead.
